<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hearing Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cochlear implants</li><li>Mid-Ear Implants</li><li>Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA)</li><li>Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hearing implants are advanced medical devices that can help individuals with hearing loss. Cochlear implants are the most common type and are surgically implanted in the inner ear to stimulate the auditory nerve. Mid-Ear implants are implanted in the middle ear to amplify sound vibrations. Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) involve a surgically implanted device that transmits sound through the skull bone to the inner ear. Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) is a rare implantation option for individuals with auditory nerve damage, bypassing the cochlea to stimulate the brainstem directly.</p></p>
