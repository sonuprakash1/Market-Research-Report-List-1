<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strap-on Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistance Sensor</li><li>Thermocouple Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strap-on temperature sensors are available in two main types: Resistance sensors and Thermocouple sensors. Resistance sensors utilize the change in electrical resistance to measure temperature, providing accurate and consistent readings. Thermocouple sensors, on the other hand, use the principle of thermoelectric effect to measure temperature. Both types of sensors are commonly used in industrial applications where direct contact temperature measurement is not possible. Users can choose between resistance sensors for reliable and stable readings, or thermocouple sensors for their wide temperature range and durability.</p></p>
