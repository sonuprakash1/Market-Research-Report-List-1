<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-compartment</li><li>Three-compartment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bipolar membrane electrodialysis technology is available in two types: two-compartment and three-compartment systems. Two-compartment systems have a single bipolar membrane that separates the anode and cathode compartments, allowing for water splitting and selective ion separation. Three-compartment systems have an additional compartment between the anode and cathode compartments, which increases efficiency by separating the electrolysis reactions from the ion transport. Both types of systems offer advantages in different applications, such as desalination, wastewater treatment, and recovery of valuable materials.</p></p>
