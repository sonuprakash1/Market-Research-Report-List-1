<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sedan Speed Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the sedan speed sensor market, active sensors require an external power source and actively transmit signals to measure speed. They offer real-time data and are more accurate but tend to be more expensive. On the other hand, passive sensors do not require an external power source and measure speed based on the changes in the magnetic field. They are more cost-effective but may not provide as precise results as active sensors. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring accurate speed measurement in sedan vehicles.</p></p>
