<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endogenous Creatinine Measurement Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jaffe's Kinetic Method</li><li>Enzymatic Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The endogenous creatinine measurement kits market consists of two main types: Jaffe's Kinetic Method and Enzymatic Method. Jaffe's Kinetic Method is a traditional method used to measure creatinine levels by measuring the color change in the reaction between creatinine and picric acid under alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the Enzymatic Method utilizes enzymes like creatininase and creatinase to convert creatinine into a substance that reacts with a chromogen, resulting in a color change. Both methods are commonly used in clinical laboratories for assessing kidney function.</p></p>
