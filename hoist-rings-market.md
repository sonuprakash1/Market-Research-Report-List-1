<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hoist Rings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Center-pull</li><li>Side-pull</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hoist rings are commonly categorized into two main types based on their design and functionality: center-pull and side-pull hoist rings. Center-pull hoist rings are designed to provide a vertical lifting point directly in line with the force being applied, making them ideal for applications where a straight vertical lift is required. On the other hand, side-pull hoist rings are designed to provide a lifting point in a direction perpendicular to the force being applied, allowing for lifting or pulling in different directions. Both types offer versatility and strength in various lifting applications.</p></p>
