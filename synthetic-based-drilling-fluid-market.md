<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic-based Drilling Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coarse Drilling Fluid</li><li>High Quality Drilling Fluid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic-based drilling fluids can be classified into two main types: coarse drilling fluids and high-quality drilling fluids. Coarse drilling fluids are generally less refined and may contain larger solid particles, making them suitable for less complex drilling operations. On the other hand, high-quality drilling fluids are more refined and contain smaller solid particles, offering better performance and stability in challenging drilling conditions. Both types of drilling fluids play a crucial role in the success and efficiency of drilling operations in the oil and gas industry.</p></p>
