<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Energy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting (Free-Standing) Tower</li><li>Guyed Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-Supporting (Free-Standing) Tower: This type of wind energy equipment includes towers that are designed to support the weight of the wind turbine without the need for additional support structures. These towers are more commonly used in areas with limited space or uneven terrain, as they can be installed in areas where guyed towers may not be practical.</p><p>Guyed Tower: Guyed towers are wind energy equipment that are supported by guy wires that are anchored to the ground. These towers are typically taller than self-supporting towers and are used in areas with high wind speeds or where space constraints make self-supporting towers impractical. Guyed towers are more cost-effective to install and maintain, but require more land space for proper installation.</p></p>
