<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Nitrogen Evaporators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Dry Bath</li><li>Water Bath</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory nitrogen evaporators are devices used in scientific laboratories to remove solvent from samples using nitrogen gas. There are two main types of these evaporators: metal dry bath and water bath. Metal dry bath evaporators utilize a metal block with holes for sample tubes, where the solvent is evaporated by heating the metal block indirectly. On the other hand, water bath evaporators use a hot water bath to generate heat, which is then transferred to samples placed in specific racks to evaporate the solvent.</p></p>
