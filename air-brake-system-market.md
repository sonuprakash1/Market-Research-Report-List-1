<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc Brake</li><li>Air Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air brake system market can be divided into two main types: air disc brakes and air drum brakes. Air disc brakes use brake pads to clamp on a rotor to slow down or stop a vehicle, providing better performance and heat dissipation compared to drum brakes. On the other hand, air drum brakes use brake shoes that press against the inside of a rotating drum to achieve braking. Both systems are vital components in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and buses to ensure safe and efficient braking.</p></p>
