<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biosimilars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Non-glycosylated Proteins (Insulin, rHGH, Interferon)</li><li>Recombinant Glycosylated Proteins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biosimilars market is divided into two types: recombinant non-glycosylated proteins and recombinant glycosylated proteins. Recombinant non-glycosylated proteins include insulin, recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH), and interferon. These proteins are produced through genetic engineering and are not modified with sugar molecules. On the other hand, recombinant glycosylated proteins are also produced using genetic engineering but have sugar molecules attached to them. Both types of proteins are essential in the development of biosimilars, which are similar versions of existing biologic drugs.</p></p>
