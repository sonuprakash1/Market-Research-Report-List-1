<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Bladder Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2D</li><li>3D</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Benchtop bladder scanners are medical devices used to measure bladder volume non-invasively. There are two main types of bladder scanners in the market: 2D and 3D. 2D scanners use ultrasound technology to provide a cross-sectional image of the bladder for volume calculation. On the other hand, 3D scanners create a three-dimensional image of the bladder, offering more accurate and detailed volume measurements. Both types of scanners are commonly used in clinical settings for monitoring bladder function and assessing urinary retention.</p></p>
