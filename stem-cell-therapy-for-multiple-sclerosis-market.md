<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) involves the use of stem cells to regenerate damaged cells and tissues in the body. There are two main market types for administering these stem cells: intravenous and intracerebroventricular. In the intravenous method, stem cells are injected directly into the patient's bloodstream, allowing them to circulate throughout the body and reach the affected areas. In contrast, the intracerebroventricular market involves injecting the stem cells into the fluid-filled spaces of the brain, known as the ventricles, where they can directly target the central nervous system and promote healing. Both methods aim to alleviate MS symptoms and potentially slow down disease progression.</p></p>
