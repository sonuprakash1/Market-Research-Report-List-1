<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Car Brake Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DOT 3</li><li>DOT 4</li><li>DOT 5</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passenger car brake fluids come in three main types: DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5. DOT 3 fluids are glycol-based and commonly used in regular brake systems. DOT 4 fluids have a higher boiling point than DOT 3 and are suitable for more demanding driving conditions. DOT 5 fluids are silicone-based and provide better resistance to moisture absorption. Each type of brake fluid is designed for specific performance requirements and should be carefully selected based on the vehicle's needs and usage.</p></p>
