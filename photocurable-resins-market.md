<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocurable Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monomers</li><li>Oligomers</li><li>Photoinitiaters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photocurable resins market consists of three main types: monomers, oligomers, and photoinitiators. Monomers are small molecules that react together to form larger polymer chains when exposed to light. Oligomers are intermediate-sized molecules that contribute to the overall strength and properties of the cured resin. Photoinitiators, on the other hand, are substances that enable the resin to cure when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light by initiating the crosslinking reaction between the monomers and oligomers, leading to the formation of a solid, hardened material with desired properties.</p></p>
