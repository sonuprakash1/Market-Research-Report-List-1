<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dependent Suspension</li><li>Independent Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dependent suspension arms are connected to both sides of a vehicle's axle, limiting the independent movement of each wheel. This type of suspension is commonly found in solid axle configurations, providing a stable ride but limited flexibility. On the other hand, independent suspension arms allow each wheel to move independently, providing a smoother and more comfortable ride. This type of suspension is often found in modern vehicles, offering better handling and performance on various road conditions. Both suspension arm types play a crucial role in determining a vehicle's overall ride quality and performance.</p></p>
