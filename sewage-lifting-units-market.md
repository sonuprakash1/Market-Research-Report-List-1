<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sewage Lifting Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-pump</li><li>Dual-pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sewage lifting units, also known as sewage pumps or lift stations, come in two main types: single-pump and dual-pump. Single-pump units consist of a single pump that operates to lift sewage from lower areas to higher levels for further treatment. On the other hand, dual-pump units are equipped with two pumps, typically functioning alternately or simultaneously, to ensure a continuous and reliable sewage lifting process. Both types play a crucial role in managing and transporting sewage effectively, albeit using different mechanisms.</p></p>
