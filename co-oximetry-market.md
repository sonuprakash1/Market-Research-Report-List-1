<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Co-oximetry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission Type</li><li>Reflectance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Co-oximetry is a medical technique used to measure the levels of various forms of hemoglobin in the blood. There are two types of co-oximetry markets: transmission type and reflectance type. In the transmission type, light is transmitted through a blood sample, and the absorption of specific wavelengths of light is measured to determine the concentration of different hemoglobin derivatives. In the reflectance type, the light is reflected off the blood sample, and the reflected light is analyzed to calculate the hemoglobin levels. Both types offer accurate and non-invasive ways to assess a patient's oxygenation status.</p></p>
